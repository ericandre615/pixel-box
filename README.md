# PixelBox

Meant to be a pixel based editing program. I really want to do pixel art with out it being raster based. Where I can work with
high resolution SVG, so "pixels" are svg rectangles. You can make some pixel art at 32px x 32px and blow it up to 5 feet without losing resolution.
I had started building a sprite editor for NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) and while I'm still working on that I want to try building a
no limits sprite drawing program. Long way to go.

Currently built with React 16 and redux.
